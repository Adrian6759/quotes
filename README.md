# Quotes Lab 08

## Feature Tasks
Feature Tasks
Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app
needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it
is run.

This project is able to locate and parse a JSON file into a java object. It allows the user to generate a random author and quote from the JSON file.



## Tests

Grader can run code by running .gradlew test or by loading project into intelliJ and pressing the run button.

## Contributions
